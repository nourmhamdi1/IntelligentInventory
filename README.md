# Intelligent Inventory Management System  

## Objectives  
- Design a system to track the real-time entry and exit of products using RFID modules.  
- Use Firebase as a real-time database for data storage and retrieval.  

## Description  
The project aims to develop an inventory management system based on an ESP32 and two RFID (RC522) modules. This system records the entry and exit of products in an inventory and synchronizes the data with Firebase in real-time. The information is accessible from Firebase, enabling optimized and centralized management.  

## Materials Used  
- **ESP32**: Microcontroller for collecting and transmitting data from the RFID modules.  
- **Two RFID RC522 Modules**:  
  - One module to register product entries.  
  - One module to register product exits.  
- **Internet Connection**: Required for synchronization with Firebase.  

## Key Features  
1. **Real-Time Tracking**: The RFID modules record product entries and exits.  
2. **Secure Storage**: The data is saved and accessible through Firebase.
